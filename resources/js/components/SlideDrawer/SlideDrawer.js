                        We have upgraded the MongoDB server from 3.2 to 3.6.

                        The scenario is like previously we were having 3.4 setup installed on Server DB01 and the feature compatibility was 3.2 running.
                        we have done upgradation to our DB01 server of 800 GB data set to 3.2  3.4  3.6 in one the Go. after doing this Upgradation we faced Performance issues of performance on PROD App.
                        but same Application is running on 3.6 properly on as UAT other PROD servers smoothly on DB04.

                        Now we have to the Downgrade of the server to back on 3.2 version. and monitoring continually.
